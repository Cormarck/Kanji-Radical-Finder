to test the kanji finder:

- download the dependencies for both package.jsons; the one within the root-folder and the one within the "server" folder.
- rename "test_database.sqlite" to "database.sqlite"

to test the Admin interface:

- navigate to /admin
- run the "createAdmin.js" file within server/oneTimeCode (pick a name and password)

thankful for suggestions on how to improve it.
